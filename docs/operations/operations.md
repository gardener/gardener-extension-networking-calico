# Using the Calico networking extension with Gardener as operator

This document explains configuration options supported by the networking-calico extension.

### Run calico-node in non-privileged and non-root mode

**Feature State**: `Alpha`

##### Motivation

Running containers in privileged mode is not recommended as privileged containers run with all [linux capabilities](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) enabled and can access the host's resources. Running containers in privileged mode opens number of security threats such as breakout to underlying host OS.

##### Support for non-privileged and non-root mode

The Calico project has a preliminary support for running the calico-node component in non-privileged mode (see [this guide](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/security/non-privileged)). Similar to [Tigera Calico operator](https://github.com/tigera/operator) the networking-calico extension can also run calico-node in non-privileged and non-root mode. This feature is controller via feature gate named `NonPrivilegedCalicoNode`. The feature gates are configured in the [ControllerConfiguration](../../example/00-componentconfig.yaml) of networking-calico. The corresponding ControllerDeployment configuration that enables the `NonPrivilegedCalicoNode` would look like:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.gardener.cloud/v1beta1
kind: ControllerDeployment
metadata:
  name: networking-calico
type: helm
providerConfig:
  values:
    chart: <omitted>
    config:
      featureGates:
        NonPrivilegedCalicoNode: false
```

##### Limitations

- The support for the non-privileged mode in the Calico project is not ready for productive usage. The [upstream documentation](https://projectcalico.docs.tigera.io/security/non-privileged) states that in non-privileged mode the support for features added after Calico v3.21 is not guaranteed.
- Calico in non-privileged mode does not support eBPF dataplane. That's why when eBPF dataplane is enabled, calico-node has to run in privileged mode (even when the `NonPrivilegedCalicoNode` feature gate is enabled).
- (At the time of writing this guide) there is the following issue [projectcalico/calico#5348](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico/issues/5348) that is not addressed.
- (At the time of writing this guide) the upstream adoptions seems to be low. The Calico charts and manifest in [projectcalico/calico](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico) run calico-node in privileged mode.
